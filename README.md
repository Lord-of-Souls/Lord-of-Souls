welcome to my GitHub Page. I am Lucas Franciscon and now graduated Data Analyst in the TripleTen Brazil's Data Analysis Bootcamp.
</p>
<p>
  My approach to technology is grounded in analytical rigor and a passion for mathematics. 
  I believe that, in today's landscape, the ability to solve complex problems with statistics and Machine Learning is what defines the agility and strategic vision of a successful business.
</p>

<p>
  Recently, I consolidated this expertise through the bootcamp, where I developed practical solutions using Python, SQL, and Business Intelligence to extract intel from large volumes of information. My goal is to translate mathematical models into clear financial and operational results.
</p>

<p>
  🛠 <strong>Technical Stack:</strong> Python, SQL, Machine Learning, Applied Statistics, and Data Modeling.
